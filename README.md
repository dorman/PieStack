# PieStack

An IoT Management Platform for security based devices that is also powered by the Restack Python API.

In order to use the project you need an api key from Restack. Go to http://restack.io to create an account.

The platform runs on Django and also includes a script for you cli gurus. :) 

Enjoy!
