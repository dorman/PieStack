A lightweight platform for Restack based off of the Python API wrapper. This project is based off of my goal to use Restack as the backend storage unit for adding devices and working with user based dashboards. My main goal for this project is to have it also be used as a platform for monitoring IoT devices that are specifically geared towards protecting against security attacks.

However, I love Restack so that's why I wanted to use them as the backend and plus I didn't want to reinvent the wheel since they are already doing a great job developing a platform that manages IoT connected devices.

In order to use the project you need an api key from Restack. Go to http://restack.io to create an account.

The platform is written in Python. :)

Enjoy!
