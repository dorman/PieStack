# PieStack

A GUI for the Restack Python API. This project is based off of my goal to use Restack as the backend storage unit for the adding devices and also having PieStack with its own features for security professionals using IoT devices. However, I love Restack so that's why I wanted to use them as the backend and plus I didn't want to reinvent the wheel since they are already doing a great job developing a platform that manages IoT connected devices.

In order to use the project you need an api key from Restack. Go to http://restack.io to create an account.

The platform runs on Django and also includes a script for you cli gurus. :) 

Enjoy!
